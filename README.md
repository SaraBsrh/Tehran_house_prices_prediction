Tehran House Price Prediction

Project Overview

This machine learning project aims to predict house prices in Tehran, Iran, using Polynomial Regression (88% accuracy) and Linear Regression (82% accuracy). Since house pricing is often unreliable and inconsistent, this model provides a data-driven approach to estimate house prices based on key features. Additionally, it analyzes which regions in Tehran are the most expensive.

Dataset

The dataset contains 3,479 house records with 8 columns:
	â€¢	Address â€“ Region in Tehran
	â€¢	Area â€“ Size of the house (sqft)
	â€¢	Room â€“ Number of bedrooms
	â€¢	Parking â€“ Availability of parking (Yes â†’ 1, No â†’ 0)
	â€¢	Warehouse â€“ Availability of a warehouse (Yes â†’ 1, No â†’ 0)
	â€¢	Elevator â€“ Availability of an elevator (Yes â†’ 1, No â†’ 0)
	â€¢	Price â€“ House price in Iranian Rial
	â€¢	Price (USD) â€“ House price converted to USD

Data Preprocessing
	â€¢	Handled missing values
	â€¢	Converted categorical features (e.g., Parking, Warehouse, Elevator â†’ Binary: 1/0)
	â€¢	Numerized addresses based on mean price ranking of each region
	â€¢	Removed outliers in the Area column
	â€¢	Cleaned numerical columns (e.g., removing spaces or commas)

Key Insights & Visualizations
	â€¢	Ranking of Tehranâ€™s areas from most to least expensive
	â€¢	Feature importance analysis (identifying the most influential factors in pricing)
	â€¢	Histograms of key features
	â€¢	Scatter plot of Price vs. Area (with size variations based on Address)

Usage

1. Install Dependencies

Ensure you have all required libraries installed:

pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Running the Project

View Step-by-Step Analysis & Visualizations

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook TehranHousePrices.ipynb

Predict House Prices
	1.	Train the model (run once before prediction):

python house_price_model.py


	2.	Predict a specific house price:

python house_predict.py

	â€¢	Enter house details when prompted.
	â€¢	The model will return the estimated price.
